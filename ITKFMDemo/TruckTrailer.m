% Truck with one trailer model.
%  This is the simplest and most well posed problem where two commutators are needed to span the space
%  Coordinates : [x0,x1,phi,theta], where
%  -  [x0,x1] is the position of the front
%  - phi is the orientation of the rear
%  - theta is the orientation of the front
% 
%  Metric has a [3,1] block structure.
% [cos(theta), sin(theta), sin(phi-theta)]
